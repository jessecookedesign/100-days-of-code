### Day 003: May 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to build a pure CSS responsive hamburger menu.

**Thoughts:** CSS hamburger menus are surprisingly simple once you figure them out. It took me a while, quite a few tutorials, and browsing a few codepens/jsfiddles but I think I got it figured out. Putting this into action now on a client's website.

### Day 004: May 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finalized the responsive hamburger menu.

**Thoughts:** Once I finalized locally, I implemented on a live site but ran into issues. More to come tomorrow!

### Day 007: May 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have much time, again, but ran through more of "JavaScript in 14 Minutes"

**Thoughts:** This is definitely longer than 14 minutes but it's been extremely helpful!
